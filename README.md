## API INTEGRATION
Description:
This project is a simple, yet functional Weather App developed using core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to fetch and display real-time weather data for any city entered by the user using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project serves as an introduction to working with RESTful APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), and creating an interactive and responsive user interface using web development fundamentals.

## What I Have Done
The project is structured into three main components:

index.html – This is the front-facing structure of the app. It includes an input field for users to type in the city name, a button to fetch weather data, and a section (#weather) to dynamically display the retrieved data.
script.js – This file handles the core logic of the application. It defines an asynchronous function getWeather() which:
Retrieves the city name from the input field.
Constructs the request URL using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Sends a fetch() request to the API.
Handles both success and error responses gracefully.
Updates the DOM with the weather data like temperature, humidity, weather condition, and wind speed.
style.css – This stylesheet enhances the visual appeal of the application. The layout is centered using Flexbox, styled with a cool color palette, and includes button hover effects for a better user experience. It is fully responsive and suitable for both desktop and mobile displays.

## Tools & Technologies Used
HTML5 – For creating the structure of the web page.
CSS3 – For styling the components and layout.
JavaScript (ES6) – For DOM manipulation and API integration using async/await.
OpenWeatherMap API – To get real-time weather data by city name.
Fetch API – To handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Where It Can Be Used
Educational Purposes – This app is ideal for students or beginners learning how APIs work and how to connect frontend applications to external data sources.
Personal Use – Individuals can use it to check the current weather of any city worldwide in a lightweight and quick way.
Portfolio Projects – Developers can enhance and showcase this app as part of their frontend development portfolio.
Learning Base for Bigger Projects – This project lays the groundwork for more advanced applications like weather dashboards, travel planners, or climate monitoring tools.

## Features & Benefits
